# Changelog

All notable changes to treescape are documented in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased] — v0.2 (in progress)

### Phase 1 — fontdue tip-label widths

- **Real glyph metrics for tip-label widths.** v0.1 estimated label width as `N_chars * font_size * 0.6` (a monospace approximation that was wrong for proportional fonts). v0.2 replaces it with fontdue advance-width measurement of the bundled DejaVu Sans on the Rust side and `fontTools` HMTX read on the Python reference side. Both produce floating-point-identical widths across the test battery.
- **New EVIDENT claim** `treescape-text-width-vs-fontdue` (ci-tier): Rust widths agree with the Python reference within 0.5 px on a 14-string × 5-size battery (70 cases).
- **API change:** `SceneOptions(avg_glyph_width=...)` is no longer accepted by the Python API; the Rust `CoreSceneOptions.avg_glyph_width` field is retained for the legacy `build_rectangular_scene` (no-measurer) fallback only. The user-facing `treescape-render` and PyO3 paths use fontdue unconditionally.
- **Canvas widths shifted.** All four golden SVG fixtures and `assets/primates.svg` regenerated; byte-determinism still holds across runs.
- **`scripts/regen_assets.py`** added — canonical `assets/primates.svg` regeneration.
- **`fonttools>=4.50`** added to `treescape-reference` runtime deps.
- The bundled `DejaVuSans.ttf` is now shipped in both `treescape-render/src/fonts/` and `packages/treescape-reference/src/treescape_reference/fonts/` so the Python wheel is self-contained.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-28

The first shippable cut. Tight v0.1 scope: load Newick, render a rectangular phylogram with tip labels, save deterministic SVG.

### Added

- **Newick parsing/writing** in `treescape-core` (hand-rolled, iterative). Handles quoted names, NHX comments (consumed in v0.1), negative branch lengths, and trifurcation roots. Strict grammar: requires trailing `;`, rejects multiple top-level roots, rejects trailing content after the semicolon.
- **Rectangular layout** with documented conventions (x = cumulative branch length, tip y = pre-order leaf index, internal y = mean of immediate children's y).
- **Ladderization** with both ascending and descending orders. The descending tie-break matches ete3's `direction=1` behavior exactly (sort key `(-size, -original_position)`).
- **Pure-Rust deterministic SVG renderer** in `treescape-render`. Sorted attributes, fixed `{:.4}` float formatting, no timestamps. Bundles DejaVu Sans for downstream font measurement.
- **PyO3 bindings** in `treescape-connector` mirroring the rustims layout (one cdylib, four `wrap_pymodule!` submodules registered in `sys.modules`).
- **`TreePlot` grammar** in the user-facing `treescape` Python package. v0.1 surface is intentionally tight: load, layout, tips, options, save.
- **`treescape-reference` Python package** — slow, readable parser/layout/renderer that serves as the EVIDENT oracle for the Rust core. Designed to be PyPI-publishable so users can verify claims independently.
- **EVIDENT trust manifest** at `evident.yaml` with eight claims pinned before implementation:
  - `treescape-newick-roundtrip` (ci): Biopython parity + own-roundtrip
  - `treescape-layout-rust-vs-reference` (ci): Rust matches Python reference within `1e-9`
  - `treescape-layout-vs-ete3` (ci): ete3 traversal + distance parity within `1e-6`
  - `treescape-layout-vs-biopython` (ci): Biopython.Phylo.draw layout parity within `1e-6` (Biopython's own functions extracted via `inspect`)
  - `treescape-layout-vs-ggtree` (release): R + ggtree parity within `1e-4`
  - `treescape-ladderize-order` (ci): tip order matches ete3 `direction=0` and `direction=1`
  - `treescape-svg-determinism` (ci): byte-identical output across runs; Rust↔Python reference byte parity
  - `treescape-tip-count-invariant` (ci): hypothesis property — N tips → N tip glyphs, all coords within canvas

### Trust contract

Claim runners live at `tests/oracle/test_*.py`. The release-tier `ggtree` runner is gated to the image at `workflow/Dockerfile.evident-release` and runs in CI only on tag pushes.

### Known v0.1 limitations (deferred to v0.2)

- Circular and radial layouts.
- PDF export (SVG only).
- Clade highlighting.
- Branch- and node-style mappings to metadata. v0.1 supports `tips(label="name")` only.
- Real fontdue-measured tip-label widths. v0.1 uses `avg_glyph_width=0.6` monospace approximation, sufficient for canvas-bounds invariant but not for aggressive collision avoidance.
- Nexus and PhyloXML parsers.
- `treescape-cli` and a `treeplot` console entry point.
- Polars/pandas dual-support; the metadata API is v0.2.

### Bundled font

DejaVu Sans (Bitstream Vera Fonts License) is bundled at `treescape-render/src/fonts/DejaVuSans.ttf`. License notice alongside.
